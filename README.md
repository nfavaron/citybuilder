# Realforce Solutions Academy

This repository is a fork of [Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate](https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/Three.js-TypeScript-Boilerplate).

# Boilerplate
When run, the boilerplate shows a green wireframe rotating cube, with OrbitControls, Stats and dat.GUI included.

It uses webpack-dev-server for the development build, and NodeJS with Express for production build.

Both server and client projects are written in TypeScript.
